# Burger

A restaurant app that lets users input the name of burgers they'd like to eat.
A user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. 
When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 
MVC design pattern followed. 
Node and MySQL used to query and route data.
Handlebars used to generate HTML.
